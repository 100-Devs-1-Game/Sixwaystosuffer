You awaken in a darkest void. Before you stands a table, behind which looms a dark, sinister silhouetteâ€” a creature that devours all light. It forces you into a twisted game. Refusal is not an option. The cold metal revolver clinks onto the table...

This game inspired by Buckshot Roulette with a twist: you load the chambers yourself, each bullet carrying a unique, ominous curse.
